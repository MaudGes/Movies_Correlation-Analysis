# Movies_Correlation Analysis

Using a dataset from Kaggle, I will perfom a small correlation analysis between the gross revenue of a movie and its features.
The dataset gathers various information about movies (name,	rating, genre, release date, director, budget...)

Hypothesis :
A movie's gross revenue is highly correlated with : 
  - Its budget (the more money is invested in a movie, the more earnings it will generate).
  - The company that released the movie (a movie released by a well known company such as Disney will generate more earnings).

The goal is also to find out whether any other features are highly correlated to a movie's gross revenue.

Thank you!
